    <h1>Old Gold Foot Keeps Walkin'</h1>

    <p>In the dawn of digital light,<br>
        Five minds set forth, their future bright.<br>
        A search engine, a marvel new,<br>
        An award won, shaped like a shoe.</p>

    <p>Golden foot, their trophy grand,<br>
        Marked a triumph few could understand.<br>
        Twenty-five years, time's relentless march,<br>
        Brought them to "The Hills," 'neath heaven's arch.</p>

    <p>But faded now, are the days of glory,<br>
        Each face etched with life's hard story.<br>
        Clutching the foot, a symbol of past,<br>
        In its gleam, their shadows are cast.</p>

    <p><i>Tin whistle solo</i></p>

    <p>At the table, memories bitter and sweet,<br>
        Of a journey once bold, now incomplete.<br>
        Glasses raised, not in joy, but in rue,<br>
        To the dreams they chased, but never quite knew.</p>
